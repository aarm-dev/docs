## Conformance Levels

| Level | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|
| **AARM Core** | R1–R5 (all MUST) |
| **AARM Extended** | R1–R8 (all MUST + SHOULD) |

---

## Required (MUST)

### R1: In-Line Authorization

Block actions before execution based on policy.
```
✓ Denied actions do not execute
✓ No effects on target systems
✓ Denial recorded in receipt
```

### R2: Parameter Validation

Validate parameters against constraints.
```
✓ Type validation
✓ Range/limit enforcement  
✓ Allowlist/blocklist matching
✓ Pattern validation
```

### R3: Step-Up Authorization

Support human approval workflows.
```
✓ Execution blocks pending approval
✓ Configurable approver routing
✓ Timeout handling
✓ Decision recorded in receipt
```

### R4: Tamper-Evident Receipts

Generate signed receipts for all actions.
```
✓ Complete action representation
✓ Policy decision and reason
✓ Cryptographic signature
✓ Offline verification
```

### R5: Identity Binding

Bind actions to identities.
```
✓ Human principal
✓ Service identity
✓ Session context
```

## Recommended (SHOULD)

### R6: Least Privilege

Support credential scoping.
```
○ Just-in-time issuance
○ Operation-specific scoping
○ Automatic rotation
```

### R7: Telemetry Export

Export to security platforms.
```
○ Real-time streaming
○ Standard schemas (OCSF)
○ Configurable filtering
```

### R8: Effect Capture

Record downstream state changes.
```
○ State hashes
○ Resource identifiers
○ Downstream correlation
```
